        <h3>Who <em>is</em> this dude?</h3>
        <p>
            I have a B.S. in Computer Information Systems from Columbia College. It seems to me that it would take some mental gymnastics to rationalize that as being somehow relevant to someone seeking to be any sort of authority on the topic of lawn care. Perhaps you could argue that the education assisted with some sort of systematic, analytic way of thinking about a topic and that I apply this toward lawn care. 
            <br>
            <em>I’m not sure if that’s true, though.</em>
            <br>
            I have been doing yard work in various capacities, though, for the past <strong>30 years</strong> - as a child doing chores, as a person doing odd-jobs for money, as an employee tasked with caring for an outdoor customer-facing space, and as a homeowner maintaining their property.
