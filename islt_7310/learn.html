            <p>
                When you take responsibility for a piece of land, there can be a lot to consider. It can feel like a burden, this section of nature determined to consume your time and money.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is possible, though, to embrace the space and to treat the land as a form of creative expression. It can also be fun to think of yourself as a king ruling over your little kingdom or maybe a servant tasked with caring for the many organisms in your alloted domain. My first takeaway for any would-be caretaker would be to <strong>make it interesting</strong> - find a way to look at the space as an opportunity instead of an obligation.
            </p>

            <p>
                Now that you are hopefully onboard with the task, how do we do this? How do you properly care for a space? These are great questions and I don't think there is a definitive answer. As long as you're not breaking laws, destroying property that will cost you (or someone else time/money), or harming innocent beings...it's really up to you. Keep in mind that nothing happens in a vacuum - things in our world are quite inter-connected and a choice you make may have downstream impacts that you didn't expect. (Cutting down a tree may cause the grass that is previously shaded to suffer) Try to be mindful of these sorts of things and act accordingly; eventually it can be quite fun to do something that will <em>positively</em> impact something else.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another thing to consider is the amount of resources you are able to output. You <em>could</em> spend lots of money and pay experts to design and maintain your outdoor space. Alternatively, you could just let nature do what it wants and spend no time or money on your property. Paying someone may quickly exceed your budgetary limiations, and doing nothing can end up creating issues with pests or trouble with neighbors or local governments. With your space as a whole, and with each individual activity, it will be up to you to decide the appropriate amount of time and energy to expend in order to achieve results that are accetpable to your needs.
            </p>
            <p>
                The most important thing to remember, though, is to <strong>HAVE FUN</strong>. No matter what, things will mostly grow back. There usually are no right or wrong answers, just creative choices, and hopefully you get to be the decision maker on at least some of those choices.

            <h3 id="section-2">Methods & Tools</h3>
            <p>
                As I previously mentioned, there are many ways to do things. For the sake of simplicity, let's assume you are taking care of a "basic" residential property - lawn, some trees, maybe a flower bed or two. You will likely need some sort of lawn mower, there are lots of choices here - gasoline-powered vs. electric, riding vs. push, etc. <a href = "https://www.weekand.com/home-garden/article/determine-size-cutting-deck-needed-riding-mower-18025741.php">You'll even need to decide what <em>size</em> mowing deck is best for your yard</a>. In addition to a mower, you may need things like a trimmer ("weed eater"), different types of shears, shovels, carts/wheelbarrows, etc. This is a great area to employ the previously mentioned philosophy of finding the right amount - amount of tools to own, amount of money to spend. Do some research and experimentation and find what works for you.
            </p>

                So you have some tools, you are going to need to develop some strategies and workflows for your work as well. I tend to gravitate to more of a "natural" approach to things - usually deferring to nature as already having figured out a better solution to whatever I'm trying to solve. The University of Missouri Extension has excellent documentation on <a href="https://extension.missouri.edu/publications/g6749">Natural Lawn Care</a> practices and can be a great help in getting you off on the right track.

                There are things that you can introduce to your lawn that can help with its success, or make things more hospitible to you and your family. Adding lawn fertilizer can make your grass and flowers thrive. You can purchase fertilizers from the store, you can hack some together from household products, or you can <a href="">create your own</a> by "composting" food scraps and other organic matter. There are other methods you can use to create fertile soil - there is vermiculture - creating "worm farms." One rediscovered method from the past is the practice of creating "Terra Preta":

            </p>
            <p>
                You will also need to think about things like pest control - bugs, animals, and invasive plants; this is another balancing act. A lot of the chemical solutions for these things come with potential risks and effects on other systems. It is important to do your homework in order to make informed decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
                You may also need to bring in soil or other materials to fill holes or level the ground. You may also bring in organic (or non-organic) material to use a mulch. <a href="https://extension.missouri.edu/publications/g6960">Here is another great guide from the University of Missouri Extension</a> on mulches.
