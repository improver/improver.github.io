        <h3>Hello and welcome to this site about my lawn care philosophy.</h3>
        <p>
            This site exists mostly as an outlet for me to express thoughts and ideas that I have had about caring for various outdoor spaces. I am not trying to tell anyone how to do anything in particular only sharing thoughts about, and methods for, doing yard work. There are many ways to approach this practice, I will share my personal perspective as it exists currently. I hope to present you with a different perspective, a new idea that resonates, maybe a method that allows you modify something in your current process - something that will provide a motivational spark in your world, as you exert your influence on a natural space.
